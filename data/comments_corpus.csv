"I disagree with her. Men will say yes to 90%  of women (its in their genes) to exept and love women. And most women are more focused on themselves, and also building a dream, a future, a nest. Wich is why they are way more conscious about their choices. The possibility of a pregnancy is in our genes. Its like we have a dream, and men love us deeply and are building for us. So rightfully women could make the whole process easier by aproaching men directly on bumble. It has to do with resistance, women resist and deny their sexual pleasures and deep longing, need and want for a man. While men often resist and deny love and giving. This is my opinion on this.

do women really want to receive? Do men really want to give. 

In other words do women really want to be fucked? Do men really want to fuck..

"I don't think any truly respectable feminist would be using the word ""beta male"" derisively in that way that she is. From what I've understood dismantling patriarchy is about acknowledging how rigid gender roles and toxic masculinity contribute towards poorer life quality for everyone, but I know that feminists don't agree on everything. Either way I agree with Aba ""Why should my masculinity be defined by approaching you?"" and also she was just wrong for saying that doing men's work isn't important when it was women's restriction from traditionally male jobs, education, and societal participation that contributed to our oppression and continue to contribute to it in many parts of the world.",UgzTzRzz1DSP8EENXSV4AaABAg,0,0

"I have concluded from this video and mainly what she said in the first few minutes, that women like her (and I'm sure men do it too) simply hate about men, or rather, project onto them everything that they dislike about themselves. She says ""why can't men do it? If it's too much of an emotional risk then that isn't someone I want to be with."" That is her saying, ""I find bumble too emotionally risky, and I just realized that I need a man who isn't like that. So men who use bumble are actually not what I need.

"In most relationships the pursuer is the partner who likes or loves more, so they put in a greater effort. They usually make more sacrifices and compromises to please or appease the partner in control. 
However, with Bumble, the fact that it's the woman who makes the first move shows that she's already interested and automatically makes her the pursuer. So any powerplay tactics to manipulate the guy this way are null and void. Which leaves only one option - love bombing. Hence her frustration in the video as she has already shown her hands upgront to the guy, and has to play her trump card early in the game.",UgztGPOydNt6RecOSch4AaABAg,1,6

"14:53 YIKES.

We were already at Soviet Union level red flags but this just blasted us into the damn stratosphere. 

No man who knows his own worth is going to be chasing women. I don't care about socio-economic status, career, net worth, or anything else. Nobody on their purpose and in a healthy mindset wants to chase somebody else, they either want to enjoy being single or want to be with someone they respect that builds them up. 

Also demonizing the single lifestyle just shows me that you're incapable of respecting your differences from other people... There's nothing wrong with having different goals from someone else. 'Players' aren't using you if you know they are players and you still stick around. At that point, you are choosing to engage with that guy and the only person you have to blame for accepting the behavior if it isn't what you're about is yourself.

Accountability appears to be a foreign language to this woman.",UgwSjsz9ZRKWcVsgY_t4AaABAg,0,0

"Shallon doesn‚Äôt represent all women‚Äî even though similar to her, I hate Bumble.

Do you understand that doesn‚Äôt make me entitled, rather it‚Äôs my desire as a lady, and perhaps unlike some I happily accept the risks that come with my former statement? Do you understand that doesn‚Äôt negate another women‚Äôs ability to use bumble happily? 
Do you also understand I may be very successful in my career, but while I chose to go that route, I still think in personal relationships men deserve respect and women should be generally submissive in the best sense of the word? You complain when women ‚Äúmooch‚Äù from you, right? So surely you can understand the need for us to have jobs, because we don‚Äôt live in a utopia of stand-up men. Of course we have to be independent enough to make our own money and have our own lives, for our protection at a bare minimum. 
But, when you meet the right person, it becomes a beautiful marriage/balance of masculine and feminine, whoever represents who in that relationship.

"This woman CLEARLY lives in a bubble and has never seen: 

1) a man's in/out box 
2) the statistics curated by the dating sites THEMSELVES (OKCupid especially is well-known for this) regarding the reply rates of women to men on their own apps. The odds are so heavily stacked against the men's favor, you're better off holding onto your sanity and not even partaking. Also factor in things like ethnicity (of which White men DOMINATE the return of replies from all demographics of women, especially the most attractive of the bunch). The numbers don't lie, ladies. 80% of the initial messages sent (as per the 2020-21 stats) were by MEN. 61% of those messages were sent to younger women, of which half were at a 5 year age difference.

Most men are used to having to send DOZENS AND DOZENS of intro messages--90% of them which will go completely ignored. The 10% or less that DO manage to get a reply are often met with very one-sided interactions of which are highly likely to fizzle out very quickly.

So fellas don't be upset if your still single you are actually winning not losing the girls are losing. But they should blame them self for making guys not say hi to them i mean they always complain even when we say hi they don't like it and guys can feel the hurt and learn from it. That's why most guys don't say hi to you in public unless your an employee at a job. This is why for men or young boys should make friends and have good connection with somebody it will really help with the dating game.

"Her comment on feminism would make sense if society's convention wasn't so tough on men when it comes to approaching when dating. When it comes to approaching the onus tends to be on men. In fact, women get ridiculed all the time for being the ones to propose to men. Many men and women see such women as weak and having low self esteem. I'm a male feminist and a lot of people that purport to be feminists conveniently forget certain truths about the movement. Feminism would advocate for a dynamic that makes our chances when dating equal. We all know men face a lot more rejection when it comes to dating. I understand to an extent why women reject so much, especially as saying 'Yes' to the wrong person can sometimes result in her homicide. Saying 'No' to the wrong person can equally do so. Sarah Everard is an obvious example, where a man of authority, a policeman pursued and murdered her. Dating can be very unsafe for women, this is abundantly clear. I have stumbled on a second point, safety.

 I would say to the person Aba & Preach are responding to: is it not feminist that there's an app where the prevalence in high rejections for men is mitigated by women having to interact with a guy if they have something positive to say to him? 

Is it also not feminist that women now have an app whereby if a guy has an aesthetic and profile that makes them uncomfortable, they do not have to engage nor reply to him at all? 

I have a feeling she would give some convoluted answer, because honestly her narrative in the video is not making sense. Also...as Aba & Preach say: it's 1 app out of like 100s if not 1000s üòÇ",UgxHqyysWzy0SgTAh5Z4AaABAg,0,0

She talks about how if a man can't say hello and make the first move the relationship will be horrible yet she really doesn't understand she is the one in this equation that has trouble making the first step, which would make her a bad candidate for a relationship by her logic. Also love how the self described feminist has no issue judging men on superficial reasons yet if a man does the exact same thing she will call it misogyny and try to ""cancel"" him. I know not all western women are like this but enough are to make men want to just check out of society.

"Feminism had valid points when women were being oppressed in the workplace decades ago...from what I see in current times women are in just as many higher paying careers as men yet men still make up 90-98% of the workforce in careers that are inherently dangerous and/or will with certainty shorten your lifespan or the enjoyability of it (hard work jobs). As she herself put it starting from 8:36 ""that's mans work and that's oppression"" (meaning she is not interested in a person who does it, she wants a high powered or wealthy person to get with her and she is frustrated.) 

She wants a controllable person from day 1 from a category of bachelor that is not going to deal with her crap. She is even mad on some petty ish about her girl finding happiness. She is mad that her friend is ""beta"" but doesn't understand that maybe her friend wants to be submissive in a relationship and feel safe with her man.

At this point feminism has divided and something else has spawned off of it...and I would not even call most of it feminism anymore. It's turned into full scale opportunism really driven by selfishness.

Many women now basically want a man to be psychic and only want to be hit on if they are already very attracted to the guy but they don't want to say anything first yet will be quick to use all the men they reject to boost their own sense of self worth. If you are listening to what this woman was saying she was basically on some oblivious mentality...men face rejection constantly even when they are not trying to flirt. Also, when a woman hits on us and we are not interested we generally try to find a nice way to make that clear without being rude...as a guy even saying hello to a woman you have to gauge her mood because if she is in a bad one and you don't know that you might just be ""the random creep who hit on her"" story she babbles about later...because to some women any man they wouldn't get with is a creep.

You can hold a door for a woman as a man and there are times where a woman will look at you with disgust for merely holding the door and not even saying a word because some women just assume men are always trying to get with them. 

Basically, she has an issue with what other woman are saying they want because it conflicts with what she wants and benefits her and as usual in society somehow that is ""unknown males"" fault so it is ok to complain about this and monetize it at the cost of men.

I had a friend once who has the financial freedom to do what he wants in life...he said something to me that sadly is becoming to seem more and more logical.

She‚Äôs not interesting so tell me why would a guy who can make a interesting convo out of nothing waste his time with someone who can‚Äôt contribute to the conversation and he can normally tell.

"Bumble is a glorified confidence booster for women. Almost the same can be said for other apps, however, I think there are more serious women on those. I gave up on all the apps and found my wife without them. Just too many games. And don't get me wrong, i'm not above playing them if I have to, but I found more success in college type areas and places where people physically are. And I chose a woman who likes to talk about her problems or our problems without yelling or insults. We discuss, rather than argue. Took a while to find her, but it was worth keeping that one standard. If I am gonna live with someone, I don't want to fight. Because do we really have to? It's a choice.

This woman is making her stand on a hill that nobody cares about. Lol, most of us just accept things as they are and work with it. 

Funny, most women loved to go on dates when you simply ask them with confidence if they'd like to go with you. Smile politely, not creepy, and choose to feel great even if she says no. With that kind if confidence I was rarely told no, even when I was being weird, on purpose, with a kilt or handlebar mustache. After every date, I'd ask if they honestly liked the stache. Not a single one liked it, and they still said yes, because my approach was sending safe signals. Simple. ""Hey, you're pretty cute, would you like to go on a date sometime?

I would even argue the pressure of an app is no where near as difficult as flirting in real life...A Sadie Hawkins dance is probably your closest comparison for women who don't have the nerve to be a real equalist at this point in history. 

Her complaints have zero to do with feminism (well maybe modern day feminism that has little to do with equality, and everything to do with control). It's clear the girl doesn't have game and is salty about it. If you don't have game, pick up some reference books, go to your local bars, and practice. Guy's aren't even as difficult as women to seduce. Just dress nice (leave the long ass nails, fake eye lashes, and sparkles at home), don't hunt in a group (he doesn't want to listen to your bitchy friends all night), casually sit next to him and strike up a conversation, don't seam overeager (let the conversation flow naturally..and if it dies suggest a game of pool), try listening to him and buying him a drink for a change, and be direct/ don't lie...I promise you, 85% of men will respond positively to just that.",UgzlNFz4N9gIxZXQXr54AaABAg,0,0

"While I agree with Aba and Preach about Bumble and women making the first move, this is also the same Bumble that tells people they cannot reject fat and trans in their dating profiles. People have the right to be attracted to what body types turn them on; and unless you're specifically seeking a trans, the vast majority of people are going to reject. In that regard, Bumble is indeed oppressive. I'm an old fart anyway - I met my wife in person, and the girl before her I had for a while, the dating app was a USENET newsgroup (you know the days when 56K dial-up was lightning fast).",UgwNtET3prXleosHcoN4AaABAg,0,0

"I want to keave my thoughts on this topic.

It is really interesting how this women is not able to understand the real concept of the app.

It is not about equality and reversing the rules.
Reality is, that nearly all women are being flooded with attention on the internet. And so on Dating Apps. 

Bumble makes sure, that the women are not being texted by guys they dont want but they can choose whoever they want to. If she doesnt like the guy he will never be able to text her. 
Problem of Choice.

When i use online Dating and have a match, i always say something like

"" Hey .... , hope you have a good day""

Why?
It is to initiate contact. People fall for the trap, that they want to prove themselves worthy to the girl.
I think, if she likes me she will answer. If she is not sure or wants the attention, just cut the conversation.
A Dating App is there to see the profiles of people you might not meet in your own bubble and if you have a match, you go on a Date. 

The only things, that should be topics in the chat are 

-where are you from
-are you 18
-when do you have timte to meet

Thats it.

Thise are my thoughts on that.",Ugyuv7_aXGBxixt0sTZ4AaABAg,0,0

"I approached my husband, it was online so it wasn't that brave lol but he said he thought it was refreshing. I am also aware that men do enjoy a chase so without playing ""games"" necessarily once I expressed interest I pulled back a little. This allowed him to step up and invest his precious time, knowing at least I was interested. Personally I think women need to realise that the ""game"" is way different for men, especially now on apps and that they may have to make initial contact with hundreds of women before they get a positive response. Expressing your interested is great for men's self esteem too and also shows your respecting their time as you understand how hard it is for them. Women have a scued view that they look desperate or weak, however I believe it shows the opposite, these qualities only come out if its true, so they are just trying their best to conceal it.",Ugz-RZrGpiz9EZyu03d4AaABAg,1,1

The prey gets stabbed, speared, shot against the will of the prey, the prey has no choice in the matter, the prey get wrecked and brings it back to his family. might want to adjust your analogy....

P.S. Bears mate for the season, they dont mate for life. Bears are animals, once mating is dont the she bear chases off the male bear or the male bear leaves. either way mother bears dont take the father bear to Bear family court and force the father bear to pay bear cub child support....",Ugxi63e-smUAqUfJFVd4AaABAg,0,0
"So I'm reposting so as to not cause a misunderstanding.  In regards to Aba's comment on men dying alone. Some people fear dying alone, or are depressed by it. I'm so the opposite of that.  I would rather die alone than live a life with someone who makes me miserable.  People who talk like the woman your covering, are people I want nothing to do with in life. They tend to overly political, toxic, and the worst people to work with or be friends with.

I don't fear old age or dying alone. Life can bring it, and I'm perfectly happy going out that way so long as its with a guitar in my hand. xD",UgyndMs_A3YkEZqtjKl4AaABAg,0,0

"This entire mindset from women is starting to bug me off real time!
You know what, I have been approached 3 times in my life, only 3... by men, all 3 times. Different situation everytime, and I had to say ""Thanks man, I appreciate it, but I don't swing that way."" but it also felt good for fuck sake! I like to be appreciated every once in a while!
Women always complain and say shit like: "" Well,, I was looking at you, from the other side of the room and you didn't care, and..."" Bitch stop right there!!!
If you want something from me, come and say it to ME! Blinking from the other side of the room in Morse code and waiting for me to make the ""move"" doesn't do shit!
Use your own words but be clear, 'cause I am done chasing! Never liked it, truth to be told... and sure as hell, I'd like someone (different from a man) to come to me, instead of me being the always chaser. Who the fuck doesn't like a compliment?!
If that's makes me a ""beta"", so be it. I am in a point at my life that I can ""rent"" p***y every day of the week (twice on weekends) and where I live it's legal, so I have no reason whatsoever to stand for your bullshit! It's easier, cheaper, and truth to be told more rewarding.
YOU chase me and show me your worth, 'cause this tired ass ""beta"" (as you said) is not going to move a single finger to chase your old ass!

It's also really easy to ghost people and just block numbers to avoid consequences. Overall, someone making a video like this to complain about dating apps, while using social media is just pointless and redundant.

"I deleted these apps, these apps ain't for the majority of guys, it is what it is, lol. 

Always start conversations without ""hey or hi, be interesting"", how the hell am I meant to initiate a conversation without greeting someone? No one does that in the real world. 
Not going to start a conversation on a date not even greeting because it's rude, so why is it fine in apps? Got to greet, have  small talk and see how things go to build up on it, can't just have interesting conversations without knowing some things about the person you're talking to. I'm not psychic enough to know what sort of things you find funny or are interesting to you. 
You match with someone, they say they're too shy to say hi in their bio, you say hi after they matched with you, and that's it and you're left wondering why match (could have been a mistaken accept, lol). 

Dating apps are just unrealistic. You take a shirtless picture, you're a fuckboy. You take a picture of yourself in your car, you're a fuckboy show off. You take a picture with you and your friends, you're a party animal. You simply add you like to go to the gym as a hobby, you're a boring narcissist gym bro, lol. Not saying only women are guilty of this, I am guilty of this too. Dating apps can make you judge unrealistically and make wild assumptions.

Reality with dating apps is it doesn't matter what you write in your bio, you can't describe who you are, a few paragraphs doesn't necessarily tell people everything about you.

End of the day, when I am using dating apps, if you hot, I swipe and most likely vice versa. Worst thing with dating apps is I find I swipe off people that in reality, I would probably find attractive, not everyone is photogenic, lol. 

Nothing wrong with the apps, I'd personally just remove the bio part of apps, first thing that catches attention is attractiveness and If I see a hot chick in public or at a bar, I can't see their bio, but attractiveness is why the approach begins initially. Apps are trying to replace something that they cannot replace, apps will never emulate what it is like to actually approach someone, say hello, get their number or even engage in a conversation.

"I just think the entire movement of feminism should stop. Feminism by definition means that you are advocating, fighting or supporting women's rights. By now, I dare to say that women and men are equal as of now. Feminists today fail to see that men have issues too, because feminists lack perspective. It is just quite sad how polarised it has all become. Now it is always about what gender has it worse and which gender is better, and it leads to so much hate and resentment. So much so, that everyone just becomes virtual keyboard warriors on the internet. All this dividedness and hate between genders leads to such low productivity when it comes to actually solving issues for both genders.

"Feminism is a Rockefeller invention to put lower pressure on wages and to further the long-distance agenda of initiating communism. Feminism as well as many other movements, ideologies government policies in general indicates to some that we are indeed moving towards communism with sprinkles of fascism in order to get there type scenario. On this course, now Central planners choose a different course for the purpose of a different agenda oh, well that remains to be seen. But on this course people with a very good knowledge base and economics monetary Finance policies and the long history of social directives will tell you that it is beyond the shadow of a doubt that if we continue on this path we will own nothing, not the past present or future fruits of Labor, and without that capacity you have no means from wish to secure a female her eggs and a sound peaceful nesting ground, and this is the likely scenario on this path But ultimately what is being demonstrated here by government and their corporate partners is that they are the sugar daddy of most all the women and that furthermore you have little to no chance at securing a female her eggs and the nesting ground for any prolonged. Of time from what you could actually measure that you are genuinely free. This channel is entertaining and all but at the end of the day it's focussed on symptoms what's wrong with society and not the root cause, so in effect you could reasonably say that travels such as these who focus on symptoms will only postpone the inevitable as a result of the inaction and stagnation we find in the symptom oriented communities, before they know it they're finding themselves working for basic rations under a very strict and completely different social contract, a social contract that only involves mandatory work for basic rations and shelter. Enjoy the cult of symptomology, it certainly requires the luxury somebody's labour. There's no such thing as free time, all-time was garnished through the labour of somebody in order to produce the opportunity to have Leisure luxury sit around time. LOL. When you gave that to the government forcing everybody to stay home and taking what looks like an awesome free paycheck, there's actually a formula for the demise of the majority and for the benefit of a few. As we've seen over thousands of years of collusion between the political process and the elites maintain power over the economy and the money system in the hands of a few at the expense of the majority.

No matter the bait or how much effort I put into a message or show interests, I know ill be judged for my photos or lack there off. Im not a pic guy. I like to live in the moment. But of course women will never get that sense online. I have a better shot a getting someone dm me because I get more dm's than actual responses. However, my rule of thumb is. Dont trust a woman that's into you. If im not good enough to get a response from someone im actively pursuing than why would a random stranger have any interests in me. Especially since im not that good looking. And no, im not being hard on myself. Ive been called a frog face in person, ive had someone laugh at me and walk away when I approached to talk to them, and I even had a girl wingman her homegirl and pitty flirted with me. And women that I do talk to are just bored. I feel like some of these traditional women just want to get their egos boosted and give some men false hope. Creating all these resentful dudes. Im not resentful at all, I understand im nobodies cup of tea and ive accepted that. But than ladies like her minimize a man's perspective. She basically says all men just need to do is ""xy and z "" and minimizes what men already have to go through. I think it be better off if women they approach the guy.

AND LMAO, the little eye movement Aba made when he said about matriarchs ""You wanna do that?!"". Wonder what imagery was going through his mind, lmfao. Too many people, like this particular lady, use ideology as some sort of mask for their insecurity, self pity, and entitlement...most of the women who are the most ""feminist"" in the sense of ""Strong, independent, women"" love men and aren't hateful of them...and they're super calm around men because they have taken the time to not treat them like this lady..like frickin lions haha. 

Oh yeah dude, I should mention, I literally have over 100 matches on Tinder, almost none of these worked out during Covid. The women are either there because of attention, boredom, etc. I had a lot of success with meeting women back in like 2015-2016, but now apps like Tinder are nearly impossible to get success in for me despite having over 100 concurrent matches. I mean, to be fair, something like 50 of them I have not sent a single message to ever because I just got bored, so many times you do all the work trying to start a conversation but the girl either never responds or just stops after a few messages or once you ask to meet. 100 matches to most of my friends sounds insane, they're like ""DUDE WTF, I can't even get like 20"". So, yes, I'm here to say, no I am not an ""alpha chad"" I'm maybe a slightly above average looking guy but point is, you just rack up match after match and women put zero effort into those apps. I can't really blame them though, they probably get barraged with messages from dudes fighting for their attention. Dating apps are very hit or miss.

And jesus...approaching in real life is probably even more confusing. I've approached women to ask them for their number/ask them out/just chat in several different contexts. I remember I was standing around at a bar/club with some friends upstairs in this mini arcade section and these two girls standing pretty close kept looking at me. Eventually I was like, eff it, and walked up to them and smiled and tried to chat. INSTANT rejection while they smiled. They said ""I feel like everything you're saying is so scripted"". What had I said so far? I literally had only said ""Hey how are you guys tonight?"" and ""Are you guys from around the (my city) area?"". I said to them ""WHAT DID YOU EXPECT ME TO SAY?!"" lol. Truth is, women probably get asked those questions a lot, sure I get it. On the other hand, they have no respect for how much guts it takes for most guys to finally throw caution to the wind and walk up to a woman expecting instant rejection or shame.",UgweRrL74hfSMgTWXZx4AaABAg,2,1

"In my opinion and this is only my opinion, most women on dating sites treat them as a dating buffet. which is to say, if you read their profiles a majority of if not all women on dating sites are looking for a man who has money, so they can spend it. they disguise the wording in ways that seems innocent but it all comes down to material and monetary outcomes. They use words like ambitious, goal oriented, successful, self sufficient ( as if paying your bills isn't self sufficient, not living with room mates or in mothers' basement), when i see these words because I have dated women i met on dating apps every last date asked personal financial questions. When the date is over, i honestly felt like I was applying for a credit card. Most women now days are clueless as to how hard it is for men to date, we are constantly being asked to live up to standards that Steve Harvey or Mr. Samuels have set, along with every women's magazines have set. These standards are not inline with the real world, and will never be inline. In short dating now days feels like, a credit check, job interview and a constant reality show like Housewives of where ever and keeping up with the Kardashians.",UgxszcrW_3-Y-H10RAF4AaABAg,0,0

Bumble just like Tinder both the man h woman must 1st like the profile before chatting is even an option. So if the lady doesn't like the guy's profile don't click the like button. You are complaining about the guy's opening line. Here is a suggestion for you. If Bumble makes you start the chat. Then set the bar for the opening line. Teach guy's what you want in an opening line. Don't just start with a hi or some other conversation starter you don't like to hear from men.,UgzjTyVUS5cHLPX0Qft4AaABAg,0,0

The pain of them ripping into my breasts with their freshly cut teeth 
The pain of engorging 
The pain of neck and shoulder pain due to huge breasts filled with milk 
Posture problems due to huge breasts and breast feeding 
NOT SLEEPING FOR YEARS because the babies want milk every couple of hours at night 
Other problems common: 
Latch problems leading to malnourishment
Weaning struggles 
Rage/ annoyance/ sadness when children naturally want to reach for and touch your nipples which you can't control
Emotional problems 
The issues of having to pull out titties in the car/ plane/ public 
Pumping and the otherworldly hell that is in itself 


There is a very small space in society for women breastfeeding and a huge bag of shit that women get that comes with being a woman and I have a huge problem that PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT HAVING TO SUFFER THE PAIN AND STRUGGLE OF BREASTFEEDING OR MENSTRUATING are now RE-NAMING US.  THE MOTHER FUCKING AUDACITY. 

Honestly, in my southeast Asian culture to this day when you have a daughter they console you, because culturally it's understood you gave birth to the less ideal sex. And you are handed a huge bag of shit to deal with and we as women grin, bear it and suffer. And people want to JOIN the club, find it too hard and start changing all the rules and names of the game - is that not the epitome of toxic and entitled masculinity. Fuck these rules.

So, the ""bad boys"" seem to win for the moment because they are able to do this and seem to have leadership even when it's false and ain't worth the approach, the struggle. I once upon a time mustard up approaching a guy who was staring for months, just for him to be flustered when I did and waiting for me to approach him again by lurking near me (after the approach), big turn off and went nowhere because I wasn't going to keep doing it. So, I'm going to have to shout out, ""betah"" it works for some women good for them, but it's just the nature of things. Women start to lose respect if she has to take the leadership role most of the time in a relationship, these are women who don't want control and to belittle men. So, if you like the masculine type of women who wants to control you by any means let her take the leadership role, have fun in that relationship eventually she will ALSO lose respect too...this is not saying we want one of those alpha craze, high value men....but a man who knows what he wants and knows where he is going in life.",UgyF_JL037Y2SvUXKhp4AaABAg,1,0

"""if it's not such a big deal...""... Sweetheart, we make the first move in the lion's share of encounters.  When we approach and engage you first, you (feminists) scream, ""harassment.""  But when you have ALL of the control, and you're empowered to make the first move from complete safety, you object again, crying ""beta!"".  Are you that afraid of rejection?  Well, welcome to equality... here's your t-shirt.  In every encounter, to you, the man is at fault and unworthy of your attention, and trying to take advantage of you... unless he approaches, says nothing, and dumps his wealth at your feet and simply walks away.  Perhaps that is not so sweet as invading like Smaug, murdering all, and taking a hoard that you have not labored to create, but feel completely entitled to.  There is no scenario in which you would find acceptable.  Is this the same delusional gal who had a problem with ""ugly successful men"" in another Aba & Preach vid?  She was mad that women smashed very successful men that (she thought) were ugly, and now she's mad because a gal has the control in a Sadie Hawkins style app?  What's the commonality in the two extreme scenarios, when either a man must engage first, or a woman has the power to ignore all others but whom she so chooses?  The common element is that it's a woman's choice... but, yes, even that is a man's fault.   Independent and empowered woman, if you don't like the app, don't use it.  This is proof that, yet again, there is no argument or scenario that a feminist can be happy with... even when they have total control.  Everything in a feminist's cosmos revolves around men being at fault, even when it's a consequence of a woman's free and informed choice.",UgwC6CmDKq57lrD2AiN4AaABAg,0,57

I would hate to see what she looks like without makeup and I bet her profile is filled with red flags.

Do you guys think this is another hypergamy issue? Hear me out.

"She wants men to say hi and ask a question, but I bet her bio is something like, ‚ÄúIf you have bad social skills please swipe left‚Äù. How the hell am I supposed to ask a good first question when most girls on these apps don‚Äôt even have a bio? If I meet a girl at starbucks or costco or whatever, I‚Äôm going to have some preexisting knowledge about some things she does. If a girl has a 6 word bio on tinder/bumble and 7 snapchat pics, that gives me absolutely nothing to initiate with. That‚Äôs why I like Bumble. It does suffer from some of the same problems as other dating apps, but because men HAVE to have what they want and part of who they are in their bio to get matches, Bumble makes women do what men do on other apps. It‚Äôs a decent alternative to tinder, because subverts some major issues with the other apps.",UgwGprAS2zB70BeIa6B4AaABAg,0,0

"""If it's so easy, why can't guys do it?!"" Well, they do it every-fucking-where else. Don't use Bumble if the one feature that makes it ""special"" is something you don't want. Stay in the other 9000 dating app options. It's basically like saying close down all the gay bars because I'm not gay and I don't want to be with men.
It's so funny when women want the most unique and special messages, all the while no info in their profile that you could actually base anything on and when it's their turn to say something, first or not, they have absolutely nothing to say.
It's also funny how she complains about ""I don't want to be with someone who doesn't put in the work... If he can't develop the basic human interaction skills... If he can't approach a person he doesn't know and say hello, what do you think that relationship is going to be like"". The irony is so god damn thick in the air, considering that's what can be true the other way around as well. She's basically complaining about the things she doesn't want to do if men don't do them.
These people want everything and give nothing.

It's kind of sad that women don't even understand how hard men have it on dating apps etc. The inequality of features and power, I showed women the male side of the apps and they were baffled by the difference. Even the women looking for serious relationships think men have it easy there and they are completely ignorant to all these things because they don't have to think about it. Women seem to think every man has it at least as easy to get dates as they do.

Anyway  my point, I like it because you state if you want kids, if your are religious and if so what kind, if you want something casual or a relationship. 
In a tinder bio that would be weird this app is built  in a way, you can use it for all your needs , if you want a hook up, you use it for that and match with people stating the same if you want to date to get into a relationship you can and only swipe right on people stating that. And for instance  I want kids one day, so if a guy that I would  normally swipe right on , checked the no kids box I know not to waste my time.

Maybe some girls like being in a position where they can pick and choose who they speak to. On top of that, maybe some guys like being in a position where they know the girl talking to them hasn't already assumed he's a creep. In this day and age guys have waaaay more obstacles when it comes to approaching women, so I can see how it would be appealing to have a female approach you and know she was comfortable enough to do so. 
Everything this girl said is obviously coming from a place of entitlement and bitterness. It has nothing to do with feminism and wanting equality between the sexes, but everything to do with someone who's struggling to understand the give and take that needs to exist in modern dating. Both men and women need to show some compassion and help each other out. If that means the women makes the first move 50% of the time, so be it.",UgxF7VaplnmCBGcVMxp4AaABAg,0,0

- ""finna fuck?"" or some variant of this;

"women are often entitled to being ""competed for"" and not initiating things lol. Bc when someone's initiating something with you, you feel wanted.
You think women are ""worth more"" than having to initiate? So what does that say about the ""worth"" you place on men when you think they should have to initiate?
If it's so easy to initiate things, you could just as easily say ""why can't women say hi?"" as ""why can't men say hi?"" this argument is contradictory, or is based on women being less socially capable than men.

So they get a lot of women, probably aren't that bothered about meaningful relationships as its so easy for them to just move onto the next one.
Lots of ex's, fuck buddies & booty calls available to them.

 That's probably not gonna feed well into any insecurities you may have.

Rather than a guy who may have his whole life together, is super confident with work and other aspects, but just not great at making that first move with women... 
As if that one thing makes a difference.

I'd argue its a positive if anything, he's less likely to play the field, cause he doesn't feel comfortable even starting that ball rolling.

"I have never used a dating app but I have texted enough girls to know that even if they said something first, more often than not, they don't know how to hold a conversation. From one word replies to random ""lol""s after a statement. The majority of women have never had to talk to a guy who didn't initiate so they never got to experience the burden or pressures of having to carry the conversation when the other person isn't as invested or simply doesn't know how to keep it interesting. As a result, the conversation completely dries up if the guy doesn't make a herculean effort to try to keep it interesting.

That's why it's often so important for guys to ""have game"" and not be awkward or antisocial. A guy needs to be able to and is often expected to keep an interesting conversation going with a woman even if she's as good a conversationalist as dried plank of wood. This expectation doesn't exist for women and I'm willing to bet that most have never even noticed their own lack of conversational skills being one of the biggest reasons for dry texts.",UgwQt9aHhtK4fYZLKrJ4AaABAg,0,0

AWALT

Look at Sweden, they bascially transformed the Real Life dating scene into Bumble. Feminists actually got the government to make the sexual harassment laws so vague, that even saying ""hello"" (literally!) can get you accused of sexual harassment.

What was the result? Men stopped talking to women. And men who want to marry are importing women from the Philippines. Sweden now has the biggest population of people from the Philippines outside of the Philippines. And what do the feminists demand from the government now? They want to BAN young women from the Philippines from settling in Sweden. ONLY young women mind you. They are still okay with guys from the Philippines settling in Sweden!

Women have simply lost it. They haven't had a strong connection to reality at any time in human history, but now they have NONE whatsoever. They live in a completely different reality.

It's funny really cause we are in a race between feminism and climate change. They are racing which can destroy humanity quicker. Atm feminism is winning, because birth rates are dropping like a stone around the world.",Ugz_HFprKxo_mr0fWp94AaABAg,0,0

My best friend also has been with a crazy woman probably a narcissist and he also is over sex and dating for a little while and we're both under 40 years old. I think it's just starting to become a thing maybe for the ones that are just tired of the b*******....

Imagine having had what I had, but also being ATTRACTIVE on top of that. I genuinely think if I didn't have good family and friends that called me out and had serious conversations with me I would've continued to go down a darker path.

"Bumble was literally created by Feminist VVomen because they said that vvomen were tired of having to deal with unwanted messages and harrassment from ""toxic Men"" on dating Apps. 

So they created a platform where they wouldn't have to be subjected to unwanted attention. The problem is that this idealistic premise fails to account for VVomen's true nature and psychology. 

They actually WANT the gratuituous attention because it makes them feel desired, empowered by rejecting Men, elevated and superior etc. 

Dating Apps are psychological power trip for most VVomen. Bumble removed that core component due to their warped Feminist perspective and didn't understand the pychology of their core constituency. There's a reason why OnlyFans and shit like that exist.",UgzzliJ4vTTND-JJpkh4AaABAg,0,1

It's not about equality, it's about having a small gimmick to give women the illusion of power.

"So she's mad that Women have ruined dating for women and she's blaming it on men...shocking. How original.
So since the dawn of time men have been approaching women with those ""basic human interaction skills"" she speaks of, often getting shut down, embarrassed and sometimes even ridiculed.

In recent years, those same ""basic human interaction skills"" she speaks of have gotten men incarcerated, often falsely labelled as creeps, offenders and ""thirsty ass f*@k n*@@as"" by women.
This is why men don't approach anymore like they used to. Some men just aren't willing to risk their livelyhood to satisfy your self esteem and need for undeserved validation. On top of that the relationship only suffers when the woman has a problem. Relationships are tailor made to cater to women, so many men wonder what would be the point for them (again because men are generally logical creatures as opposed to emotional creatures).

So if you've got an issue with the Bumble app or men not approaching your ass, address your questions to the people responsible for it being that way (women) not the people who are openly victimized by it (men). You wanted it, you fought for it, you got it now you're crying about it. Just take some accountability for once in your life or nothing will ever change...Also my best and longest lasting relationships have been the ones where the girl approached me.",Ugww9BisAQ4uHlF21LN4AaABAg,0,1

Also weird that ladies like her are always complaining about beta males, while their demands describe those guys.
Not badmouthing beta males, as decent ones have limits, too.
The to me lower beta males are those who let her chain him etc... not always literal chains.
 
But it's true, guys like to say ""nah, imma approach first, cuz i'm alpha"", but when a nice lady does it and is serious about it, his heart will melt, and he'll show his beta side.
Same for me, yes. I have my standards, but compromise from both sides is what makes the best relationships.
 
But yeah, this is the new world, where men hold back, in case of potential red flags, which may be hidden in pixels, as we cannot hear how someone types something, in what tone.
We bad? Then we'll stay away from you, fine with us... Not good? We still have to date you?!
Make up your mind, as we are humans, too, not rocks(i wish i were, tbh), and otherwise you won't see us, for real.
 
Good luck dating, miss Shallon. Good luck having and keeping decent men around you.
Also, this is why guys tend to either stay away from dating anyone, or open up like i did, first for feminine enough transladies, then for feminine enough femboys.
I guess the ones i mentioned could thank people who talk like that, but it's only cuz of the pain of another category of people.
For now i just have some s*lc0ne toys(yes, men have them, too), but if life gets better for me, and i have my own place, i'll dodge every single potential red flag i learned about.
I'm tired of hypocritical people, and will only trust the ones showing no red flags.
Don't get mad at me for giving up, i at least still will try dating... preferably at home or less crowded place, as i'm still an introvert.

Her perspective is interesting. I've never been on Bumble but I distinctly remember thinking it wouldn't be the app for me because all of the guys on it would be really confident and probably out of my league. I think my rationale was that you'd have to be really secure with yourself to be on an app where women are the ones who are making the first move (because women are more picky). So I thought it would be filled with fitness guys or shallower men who care a lot about their looks. I'm surprised to hear that it's betas on there.,UgzDgeYZWL2Jw9K6epp4AaABAg,2,1

Thank you but I have someone (half the time they're lying they just not interested in you)...or

No thank you...and

Some are even rude enough to say get the F out of my face or just roll their eyes at you and discussed even if you approach them in a nice manner....

Most Women are already fragile as it is emotionally and would go even CRAZIER wondering why she heard NO more than YES...

3 said No 
3 said they had a boyfriend 
2 said get the f out my face
1 said give me your number and I'll think about it...(probably won't call)

The reason why she's getting mad is because she's way past her f**** prime Mrs potato Head needs to just calm down and realize men do more of the asking out than women do. You have one f**** app that you have to talk to the man first one app out of how many.  She's getting judged like men do and getting turned down because of how she looks and her age and a lot of her  personality. Bumble is just a little bit of what we have to deal with and you're asking for it there's no take backs  bitch.

"These types of women like to leverage a man‚Äôs admiration for them to get things out of him that she would otherwise have to work for despite her having no intent to actually reciprocate those feelings. I‚Äôve seen women get money out of guys that they‚Äôd never date or hookup with; I‚Äôve seen women who use men who admire them to make their partner or some other guy jealous; I‚Äôve seen them get meals or even promotions on the job. Makes it much easier to string them along if men have to do the approaching/courting. Men let women down much easier. In most cases, the most a woman gets used for is sex (and some would call that a mutual exchange).

Instead of just sitting around on their socio-cultural metaphorical throne and swiping (mostly)left or right on their line of suitors.

In reverse, it may also be a way to stop men from acting like they're the womens private minstrel show.

It always baffles me, though, that we are living in a different era, with modern ideologies, yet women love referencing shit that predated modern society, while still preaching ""women empowerment"" and ""equality."" Of course men hunted more than women...we are fukin' stronger anatomically. But we aren't hunting beasts anymore. We don't venture outside and hunt sabre-tooth tigers and woolly mammoths for meat.  It's like I'm living in the land of constant, innate retardation. Why do humans make being conscious such a complexity? You like someone? Tell them. You want to chat?

Its basically an echo chamber with her, nothing comes in but everything she says comes out. Even when speaking on another person's point of view she still discards it and only considers her own point of view solely as a rebuttal and not in consideration that her view is wrong. I believe this feeds into her sociopathic narcissistic personality that makes it nearly impossible for her to not only empathize, but hold a stable relationship with anybody, this in turn is refueled by the fact that she views men this way because of the fact that she can't see her own psychological problem that makes it impossible for her to actually respect or love another person.",UgzqN1q3qRb_PqMV8nR4AaABAg,0,0

"Why I HATE FEMINISM, and Women should HATE FEMINISM as well!  
It has nothing to do with equality, rather superiority!  It is hostile toward men and has doctrines that are not only hypocritical, but abusive.  It creates insolent pride in those who adhere to it, and completely harms young men and causes identity issues and shame through bigoted and prejudice thinking and practices!  Women the only reason that we have equal rights is because of men!  Men created tampons allowing women to work.  Men passed the laws allowing women to vote.  Men..men..men.  Men donated the sperm to create you! 

It has also damaged women and lied to them causing them to actually believe they do not need men, leaving women lonely and unfulfilled later on in their lives.

Not to mention the hypocrisy feminists practice by shaming submissive women, who like to shave and actually love men.  Women who honor men and know they are invaluable and to be respected!  It shames women who choose to stay at home and fulfill a mothers most important purpose in raising their children; a privilege that most normal single mothers would do anything to have.

It has to do more with winning the gold medal in the oppression Olympics, and is a delusion women living in the most Free society created; meanwhile Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, Saudi Arabia.

It feels like most women these days thing that men are these robots that feel nothing. Naw we do. We as men understand that. Because if that dude does decide to talk about his feeling, in the rare instances, it's usually to a man from what I've seen around me. I have male friends who are married to wonderful women.

"At some point in the video, she said  ‚Äúwhy is it our job to approach you?‚Äù I was vividly confused üòê. In my head I thought ‚Äúhmm ü§î why should they approach us?ü§îü§î‚Äù then I realized this tine tiny fact that men face. From  childhood as a young black boy in America (as well as all men at a young age) we‚Äôre raised to respect women, protect them, provide for them, and be a all around gentleman. And I‚Äôd sit there thinking ‚Äúok that  sounds good but how do I do that?‚Äù My father was a respectful gentleman, so I figured I‚Äôd take after his idea, so I started dating around and see how it goes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a handsome well mannered and behaved guy, so it shouldn‚Äôt be so hard‚Äù I thought too myself but I couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth at that point. As guys in this society in this day and age, we constantly have to make the first move. That first opening sentence that places you in certain position or spot on a girl‚Äôs ‚Äúfriend zone list‚Äù (now I‚Äôm not gonna say that guys don‚Äôt do the same thing, we just don‚Äôt do it as often) which is very difficult. Statistics show that men, are the first to approach a woman. They somehow then have to make their one approach, better than all of the previous suitors the girl met previously. And then after that a lot of legwork. I was having a lot of trouble dating, I was with cute girls that had a horrible personality, and I was stupidly turning a blind eye to it, not realizing the dumb mistakes I was getting into that left me with a lot of emotional hurt. Thankfully I recognized the wrong choices in relationships to begin to correct those issues and realize how toxic of the relationships I was in and learn how to further avoid them. Now I‚Äôm not going to say that men don‚Äôt enjoy approaching the woman, I know I didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs very pleasing and fun. But they‚Äôre not going to lie and say that it‚Äôs easy. It‚Äôs damn near difficult. You have to figure out your own game or your own way introducing yourself. Trying not to do to much but just enough for just a sliver of a chance that the girl might text or call back. Being yourself but not too much of yourself (which sounds like a dumb logic) to the point where they might pull back. And trying not to get labeled as the ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù or ‚Äúbro‚Äù(which equals friend zone) although it‚Äôs good to be a genuine human being but that‚Äôs not the point. I‚Äôm 22 now about to turn 23 (so I‚Äôm young but I‚Äôm also very logical about everything especially relationships) I can never fully understand why is it that certain women want men to do all the work to get in a relationship. I‚Äôm very much ok with making the first approach because as preach said, that‚Äôs what us men have to do daily, but like Abba said, this the one app that turns the tables on the dating approach. So my question is,  like the woman in the video, do all women feel like this or have this type of perspective?
I‚Äôd love to have a logical conversation with anyone about this topic because I‚Äôm eager to learn on both men and women‚Äôs perspective on this topic.",UgzwZ_R_hA88THfr3G54AaABAg,0,6

The idea men alone must be chasers is crap, neither sides are perfect at the paradigm of connective relations.

This women is very angry and hurt that her ego isnt being stroked.

She wants an alpha man,but with quiet soft beta undertones when it suits her needs.

The very ideal is shes been indoctrinated to hate men even if she gets what she wants,she wont be happy, she will continue to find fault and make videos, and move on and complain.

Shes the type that remains in the woe is me, how dare you not give me   my unreasonable standards.

How dare you be a man who bends and crawls, approaches.

Then turns around and states ladies dont go out and try to find and learn what you want, do not do it ladies.

Lol did she leave her observation skills on vacation. 

When the truth is both persons should show effort and conscious know how.

She to not blame and show blind bias for the start of , use of an app that she hates .

Because, some thing about giving up power, lol

I'm let you in on something neither party is in full power. the conscious state of initial attraction is tied into harmones yes, then in the conscious state of the intellect second.

But the one standard that she speaks of is initial interest.

But the truth is life has created a double edged bias in her thoughts and emotions.

She borderline hates men, she isnt trying to help her fellow ladies either.

So she is just an angry bitter hater, whinning how unfair that she doesnt have her disney dream yet.",UgwAMCIi6JPVOu_kVR14AaABAg,0,6

Girl I can‚Äôt. This is the type of things people do when looking for attention. Any kind of attention that is. 
I approached the man I‚Äôm with and would do it all over again. 
The problem is she‚Äôs not being approached, probably because she‚Äôs not approachable. While also being ignorant to the fact that with that attitude she‚Äôs probably going to end up being a sugar mama and all this feminist crap will be out the window. This has nothing to do with a Man not being capable. Sounds like no one‚Äôs interested. Sis life doesn‚Äôt work that way, do better.

"The problem with her use of the animal kingdom and the analogy of the animal coming to the hunter is a very weak and shallow analogy that doesn't even support her point. It actually weakens her point because the point of the app is to allow women to control who they wish to select engagement and communication with and not be pestered by men who don't fit their standards. The idea of hunters not being able to catch their prey is a strawman analogy here as the app is aiming to reduce predatory or abusive behaviour (not that I agree with that). 

A robust analogy from the animal kingdom that would respond to her whack one is that males always compete for the attraction of the females in most species. They often dance, show their attributes off, fight other males, show dominance etc and the female chooses her male.. this app would be more fitting to that analogy. Guys flexing their attributes and then women choose.",Ugw9NCgNM1-419Ct8pV4AaABAg,2,17
