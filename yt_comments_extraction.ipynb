Do you understand that doesn’t make me entitled, rather it’s my desire as a lady, and perhaps unlike some I happily accept the risks that come with my former statement? Do you understand that doesn’t negate another women’s ability to use bumble happily? \\nDo you also understand I may be very successful in my career, but while I chose to go that route, I still think in personal relationships men deserve respect and women should be generally submissive in the best sense of the word? You complain when women “mooch” from you, right? So surely you can understand the need for us to have jobs, because we don’t live in a utopia of stand-up men. Of course we have to be independent enough to make our own money and have our own lives, for our protection at a bare minimum. \\nBut, when you meet the right person, it becomes a beautiful marriage/balance of masculine and feminine, whoever represents who in that relationship. Anything outside of meeting that with love is caused past wounds flaring, a fear of intimacy and need for control (I’ve been there). Guys— I hear ya, but you’re sounded a bit too triggered over this. Then again maybe I am 😂 will always be one of those women who never falls into the stereotype, and sometimes it sucks… sigh. But wouldn’t change it',\n",

The odds are so heavily stacked against the men's favor, you're better off holding onto your sanity and not even partaking. Also factor in things like ethnicity (of which White men DOMINATE the return of replies from all demographics of women, especially the most attractive of the bunch).

The 10% or less that DO manage to get a reply are often met with very one-sided interactions of which are highly likely to fizzle out very quickly.

In fact, women get ridiculed all the time for being the ones to propose to men. Many men and women see such women as weak and having low self esteem. I'm a male feminist and a lot of people that purport to be feminists conveniently forget certain truths about the movement. Feminism would advocate for a dynamic that makes our chances when dating equal. We all know men face a lot more rejection when it comes to dating. I understand to an extent why women reject so much, especially as saying 'Yes' to the wrong person can sometimes result in her homicide. Saying 'No' to the wrong person can equally do so. Sarah Everard is an obvious example, where a man of authority, a policeman pursued and murdered her. Dating can be very unsafe for women, this is abundantly clear.
